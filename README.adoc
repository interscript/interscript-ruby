= Interscript: Interoperable Transliteration Schemes and a Ruby implementation

== Introducation

This repository contains a number of transliteration schemes from:

* BGN/PCGN
* ICAO
* ISO
* UN (by UNGEGN)

The goal is to achieve interoperable transliteration schemes allowing quality comparisons.


== STATUS (work in progress!)

These transliteration systems currently work:

`bgnpcgn-rus-Cyrl-Latn`:: BGN/PCGN Romanization of Russian
`iso-rus-Cyrl-Latn`::     ISO 9 Romanization of Russian
`icao-rus-Cyrl-Latn`::    ICAO MRZ Romanization of Russian
`bas-rus-Cyrl-Latn`::     Bulgaria Academy of Science Streamlined System for Russian


== Usage
