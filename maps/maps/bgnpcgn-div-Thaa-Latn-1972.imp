description: ROMANIZATION SYSTEM FOR MALDIVIAN BGN/PCGN 1972 System
notes:
  - Maldivian writing is read from right to left.
  - In the vowel and Diacritical Mark columns x represents any Maldivian consonant character. A Roman vowel letter follows the romanized Maldivian consonant
  - Alifu(އ) is romanized [’], except when brearing a vowel ,marker, in which case it is not represented in romanization.
  - Nūnu(ނ) appearing immediately before bā, dālu, d̦aviyani, or gāfu, and not braring a vowel marker or sukunu, is romanised [ň];otherwise [n].
  - Where sīnu is followed by hā, or nūnu by yā, a raised dot or slash may be employed in order to differentiate these form shaviyani and nyaviyani respectively
