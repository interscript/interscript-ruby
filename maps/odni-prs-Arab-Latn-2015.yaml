  This system is the Intelligence Community (IC) standard for
  the transliteration of Persian (Farsi)
  and Dari names that is applied to all final written reports
  and products for IC consumers. It is not
  intended to eliminate variations of a name that can
  contribute forensic information. Rather, it is
  to provide an IC standard Romanized (English)
  transliteration from Persian (Farsi) and Dari that
  can then be linked to forensic information in ways that
  will help identify the referent of the
  name.

  In cases where an individual’s name has already been
  transliterated in a variant spelling, the IC
  Standard spelling should appear first, followed by the
  variant spelling(s) in parentheses at the
  first usage. In addition, if the original Perso-Arabic
  script spelling is known, that spelling should
  also appear in parentheses following the name, if possible,
  following best practices of the issuing
  organization and taking into consideration information
  system capabilities. This convention is
  designed to ensure that vital forensic information is not
  lost while maintaining consistency.

  For names of individuals who are not part of the Persian-(
  Farsi) or Dari-speaking community,
  but whose names are encountered in Farsi or Dari, use the
  relevant IC transliteration standard for
  names from that language (e.g., Mikhail, Yitzhak, Abu-
  Murtada). Spell names of individuals
  from languages that are written in Roman letters as they
  are spelled in those languages (e.g.,
  George Clooney, Jorge Garcia, Georges Pompidou).
  In the case of active senior government officials in the
  online CIA World Factbook and the
  online directory of Chiefs of State and Cabinet Members of
  Foreign Governments, the spellings
  given in these online reference works should be used in
  place of the IC Standard, with the IC
  Standard included as a variant in parentheses at the first
  usage. For any individual who has at one
  time been listed in the Factbook or Chiefs of State
  directory but who no longer appears in those
  resources (i.e., is no longer a government official), the
  IC Standard spelling should appear first,
  with the spelling, if known, as it previously appeared in
  those resources listed within parentheses
  at the first usage (e.g., former president Mahmud
  Ahmadinezhad (Ahmadi-Nejad).

  The primary goal is to produce a consistent Romanized
  transcription of names that is specifically
  readable to the English-speaking non-specialist. The system
  uses the 26 letters of the standard
  (English) Roman alphabet plus the apostrophe and hyphen.
  Some ambiguities in the Romanized
  form will occur without the use of diacritics. However,
  within the context of a report, where
  additional information about the individual is provided,
  the referent will be clearly identified.
  This system will be used in conjunction with online tools,
  name dictionaries, and lists containing
  conventional spellings of names of well-known individuals.

notes:
  - |
    This standard is intended only for those Afghan names that
    have a common bond or similarity with Iranian names. It
    should not, for example, be used for names of Pashtuns, for
    which the Pashto IC Standard should be used.

  - |
    Alef maqsura (final yeh pronounced as “a”): should be written “a” as in
    “Musa”.

  - |
    Digraphs: No distinction is drawn between digraphs
    such as sh and single contiguous letters (e.g., s followed
    by h).

  - |
    Long/short vowels: There is no distinction made in
    Roman between long and short a: E.g., Farhad (first a is
    short, second is long).

  - |
    Diphthongs: Diphthongs are written ei and ow respectively:
    Hosein; Khosrow.

  - |
    Double consonants: Double consonants represented by the
    tashdid are shown by doubling the
    Roman letter: Mo'azzami, Tavakkoli, Sajjad. Exceptions: Ein
    and consonants represented by
    Roman digraphs (e.g., sh, ch) are not doubled (Mobasher,
    not Mobashsher). Double letters
    are only used for tashdid (Hosein, not Hossein) or to
    reflect “sun-letter” assimilation (see
    below). Special care should be taken when possible to
    discriminate between doubled and
    non-doubled letters in names that are otherwise
    indistinguishable in their transliterated forms:
    Hasan (حسن (vs. Hassan (حسان(

  - |
    Compound first names will be written as distinct words:
    Ali Reza (not Alireza or Ali-Reza);
    Mohammad Hosein (not Mohammadhosein or Mohammad-Hosein),
    with the exception of cases identified below.

  - |
    Arabic-origin names that incorporate the word “Allah” are
    transliterated as one word, with the letter ‘o’ replacing the
    alef in Allah (Azizollah, Rahimollah).

  - |
    Name-internal Arabic definite article "al" (‫)ال‬: Common
    in many names borrowed
    from Arabic, the transliteration should follow the Arabic
    rules for “sun letter” assimilation in spoken form and
    reflect the nominative case. That is: Abdorrahman, not Abd-
    al-Rahman. (The Arabic sun letters are: ‫ت‬،‫ث‬،‫د‬،‫ذ‬،
    ‫ر‬، ‫ز‬،‫س‬،‫ش‬،‫ص‬،‫ض‬،‫ط‬،‫ظ‬،‫ل‬،‫ن‬ . These correspond with
    d, l, n, r, s, sh, t, and z.) Note that the moon letters (
    i.e., all other Arabic letters) are not assimilated (e.g.,
    Abdolhasan, Abolfazl). Note also that the “Abdollah” and
    “Abdol + attribute of Allah” names are written as a single
    word, as are other names that contain the definite article:
    Shamsoddin (not Shams-al-Din), Nezamoddin, etc.

  - |
    Name-initial Arabic definite article "al" (‫)ال‬: For
    Arabic-origin names starting with the definite article “al” (‫)
    ال‬, follow the Arabic standard of al-Sisi (‫)الصیصی‬ (not
    Alsisi or Assisi) and forego sun-letter assimilation.

  - |
    Arabic "family marker" of Al (‫)آل‬: For Arabic-origin
    names starting with the "family marker" of Al (‫)آل‬,
    follow the Arabic standard of Al Davud (‫داود‬ ‫)آل‬ (not
    Aldavud or Aledavud).

  - |
    Kunyas: In the rather rare case where
    a Persian uses a kunya (a name for an adult normally
    derived from his or her eldest child, and sometimes
    employed as a nom de guerre), this name will be rendered
    with a space separating the two elements (Abu Hosein, Abu
    Ghasem). Note that this does not apply when the person's
    given or family name was derived from a predecessor's
    kunya. In these cases, the leading element should be
    treated as a prefix as indicated below (Abuhosein[i],
    Abughasem[i]).
