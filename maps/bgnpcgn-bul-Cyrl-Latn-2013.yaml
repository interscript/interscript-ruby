description: |
  This system reflects the Bulgarian national system officially adopted
  by state decree in March 2009. It was adopted by BGN and PCGN in 2013,
  replacing the BGN/PCGN system of 1952.

notes:
  - When in final position, “ия” is romanized as “ia” (e.g., София = Sofia; София-Град= Sofia-Grad).
  - An exception to the romanization system is allowed for the name of the state. Thus, България is romanized as Bulgaria.
  - The Romanization column shows only lowercase forms but, when romanizing, uppercase and lowercase Roman letters as appropriate should be used.

tests:
  - source: София
    expected: Sofia
  - source: София-Град
    expected: Sofia-Grad
  - source: България
    expected: Bulgaria
