notes:
  - This standard is intended only for those Afghan names
    that have a common bond or similarity with Iranian or
    Arabic names.  They should not, for example, be used for
    Pashto names, for which a separate standard should be used.
  - Long/short vowels:- There is no distinction made in Roman
    between long and short a:-  E.g., Farhad (first a is short,
    second is long).
  - Double consonants:-  Double consonants represented by the
    tashdid are shown by doubling the Roman letter:-  Mohammad.
    Exceptions:-  Consonants represented by Roman digraphs (
    e.g., sh, ch) are not doubled:-  Mobasher [not:-  Mobashsher]
    .  Double letters are only used for tashdid (thus, Hosein [
    not Hossein]) or to reflect the ‘sun letter’ assimilation (
    see below).
  - Hamzeh:-  The hamzeh is represented name-internally by an
    apostrophe, as is the ain.  Name-initially, however,
    neither hamzeh nor ain are indicated in transliteration (
    e.g., Abdorrahman, not 'Abdorrahman).
  - Digraphs:-  No distinction is drawn in Roman between
    digraphs such as sh and single contiguous letters (e.g., s
    followed by h).
  - Arabic definite article "al" ('the'):-  Common in many
    names borrowed from Arabic, the transliteration should show
    the 'sun letter' assimilation rather than the “l” for the
    lam.  That  is:-  Abdorrahman.  Note also that the "Abdol +
    attribute of Allah" names are written as one unanalyzed
    word, as are other names that contain the definite
    article:-  Shamsoddin (not Shams al-Din), Nezamoddin, etc.
  - Diphthongs:-  Diphthongs are written ei and ow
    respectively:-  Hosein; Khosrow.
  - Yeh maqsura (final yeh pronounced as “a”):-  should be
    written as “a” as in “Musa”.

  - Special Rules

  - Hyphens:-  A hyphen is used to indicate the ezafeh
    construction:-  Arshad-e Ameri
  - Borrowed names that incorporate the name of God (Allah)
    are transliterated as one word, with the letter "o":-  E.g.,
    Abdollah, Ayatollah, Azizollah.
  - Foreign names borrowed or appearing in Dari are spelled
    according to the standard Western tradition (even if there
    is an Arabic or Dari version of the same name):-  Joseph,
    Michael.
  - Common suffixes, such as gol, pur, mand, yar, zadeh,
    etc., as well as nesbeh (‘relationship’ (to place of birth,
    etc.)) names derived with these suffixes  (e.g., abadi) are
    written as part of the name:-

    gol		Parigol, Ziagol
    pur		Shahpur, Mehrpur
    mand		Gulahmand
    yar		Aminyar
    zadeh		Ismailzadeh, Karimzadeh

    abadi		Kamalabadi
