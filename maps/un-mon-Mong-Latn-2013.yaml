  The United Nations resolution III/8 in 1977 recognized the Scheme for
  a Chinese Phonetic Alphabet (Pinyin) as China’s official Roman alphabet
  scheme and recommended the alphabet as the international system for the
  romanization of Chinese geographical names. In China Mongolian
  geographical names are transcribed directly from the Mongolian script
  into Pinyin. The scheme was published in Toponymic Guidelines for Map
  and Other Editors: China, 19821.

  The system is used in China and in international cartographic
  products.

  Mongolian uses a vertical script. Transcription of Mongolian names is
  made from their proper pronunciation based on the written form of the
  Mongolian language and Qahar vernacular, with Zhenglan as its
  representative pronunciation. Due to the complex nature of the script
  the romanization scheme is not reversible, e.g. the name of the city
  Hohhot is written ᠬᠥᠬᠡᠬᠣᠲᠠ but may be transliterated as kökeqota.

notes:
  - The long and short Mongolian vowels are not distinguished in the
    spelling for general use, but in recording the pronunciation of
    place-names, the long vowel is represented by duplication.
  - Where two Roman equivalents are given, the second (in brackets) is
    used for recording the pronunciation of place-names while the first
    form is for general use.
  - In the table only word-initial character variants are shown.
    Depending on the position in the word many variants of the characters
    are used as well as some ligatures. These features are not covered here.
  - For technical reasons the characters of the Mongolian script are
    turned 90˚ anti-clockwise.
