description: |
  This romanization system corresponds to that devised in 2002 by the
  State Department of Geodesy and Cartography of Georgia and the
  Institute of Linguistics of the Georgian Academy of Sciences, and
  approved by Presidential Decree 109 of 24 February 2011. It represents
  the Mkhedruli alphabet, as presently used in Georgia. This system was
  adopted by BGN and PCGN in 2009, superseding the BGN/PCGN system of
  1981.

notes:
  - This system denotes ejective (glottalised) consonants by means of
    an apostrophe. The BGN/PCGN 1981 system instead used the apostrophe to
    denote aspirated consonants (letters 8, 21, 22, 26 & 27).
  - The Romanization columns show only lowercase forms but, when
    romanizing, uppercase and lowercase Roman letters as appropriate should
    be used.
