  This system is the Intelligence Community (IC) standard for the transliteration of names
  from Hindi and Urdu that will be applied to all final written reports and products for IC
  consumers. It is not intended to eliminate variations of a name that can contribute
  forensic information. Rather, it is to provide an IC standard Romanized (English)
  transliteration from standard Hindi and Urdu that can then be linked to forensic
  information in ways that will help identify the referent of the name.

  There are typically a number of ways that names can be Romanized from either
  Devanagari (Hindi) or modified Arabic (Urdu) scripts. Ambiguities can result from the
  Romanization of Hindi and Urdu names for several reasons, including the fact that some
  sounds in South Asian languages (e.g., retroflex consonants, voiced aspirates) have no
  equivalent in English or other European languages. In the case of Urdu, as in the original
  Arabic source of many Islamic names, short vowel markings, double consonant marks
  and other diacritics that would clearly distinguish the name are almost always omitted
  from standard written texts. And many Islamic names of Arabic or Persian origin reflect
  spelling distinctions from those languages that are lost in modern Urdu pronunciation
  (e.g., three distinct Arabic letters all represent the identical sound [s] for Urdu speakers);
  transliterations might either maintain those spelling distinctions or ignore them entirely.
  And, as in the Arabic source, names containing the Arabic definite article ‘al’ (‘ul’) show
  anticipatory assimilation in pronunciation (e.g., Shams al Din > Shamsuddin);
  transliterations may either reflect spelling or pronunciation in such cases.

  Because Hindi and Urdu overlap so extensively, it is desirable to correlate Hindi and
  Urdu transliterations as much as possible. In the area of names, this can become
  problematic when the Urdu spelling accurately reflects original Arabic spelling while the
  Hindi spelling was phonetically-based, in essence, already a transliteration. This would
  argue for ignoring Arabic/Urdu spelling distinctions not reflected in pronunciation in
  either Urdu or Hindi (e.g., letter sin versus letter sad) while maintaining Arabic/Urdu
  spelling distinctions like Hindi also maintains (e.g., qaf as in Qutubbin versus kaf)).
  However, this is not always possible (see Hindi va versus Urdu wau).

  In cases where an individual’s name has already been transliterated, that is to be indicated
  – as found – in parentheses immediately following its rendition in the transliteration
  standard (e.g., Muhammad Khulud (Mohamed Khulood)). In addition, if the original
  Devanagari or Arabic-script spelling is known, that spelling should also appear in
  parentheses following the name, if possible, following best practices of the issuing
  organization and taking into consideration information system capabilities. This
  convention is designed to ensure that vital forensic information is not lost.

  For names of persons who are known to not be part of the Hindi- or Urdu-speaking
  community, use the relevant IC transliteration standard for names from that language
  (e.g., Mikhail, Yitzhak). A translator’s note may be used to clarify the known origin of
  the person. Spell names of individuals from languages that are written in Roman letters as
  they are spelled in those languages (e.g., George Clooney, Jorge Garcia, Georges
  Pompidou).

  In the case of active senior government officials in the on-line CIA World Factbook and
  the on-line directory of Chiefs of State and Cabinet Members of Foreign Governments,
  the spellings given in these on-line reference works should be used in place of the IC
  Standard. For any individual who has at one time been listed in the Factbook or Chiefs of
  State directory but who no longer appears in those resources (i.e. is no longer a
  government official), the IC Standard spelling should appear first, with the spelling, if
  known, as it previously appeared in those resources listed within parentheses at the first
  usage.

  The primary goal of this system is to produce a consistent Romanized transcription of the
  name that is readable to the non-specialist. The system uses the 26 letters of the standard
  (English) Roman alphabet. Some ambiguities in the Romanized form will occur without
  the use of diacritics. However, within the context of a report, where additional
  information about the individual is provided, the referent will be clearly identified.
  Additionally, this system will be used in conjunction with on-line tools, name dictionaries
  and lists containing conventional spellings of names of well-known individuals

notes:

  - |
    Long/Short Vowels: Long and short vowels are not distinguished in the system:
    The borrowed Arabic name Samir could represent two distinct names, one with a
    long /a/ (Saamir) and one with a long /i/ (Samiir). One solution would be to use
    /ee/ to stand for the long /i/, as is often done (Sameer). The IC Standard will not
    distinguish between these.

  - |
    No distinction is made between: retroflex and non-retroflex consonants; and
    nasalized vowels and vowels followed by /n/.
  - |
    No distinction is made between the several Arabic letters with the same phonetic
    value in Urdu: e.g., letters sin/svad, zal/ze/zoe.
  - |
    A distinction is drawn between Urdu letters qaf and kaf (and correspondingly,
    Hindi qa and ka).
  - |
    A distinction is drawn between aspirated (e.g., /d/) and nonaspirated consonants
    (e.g., /dh/), with the exception of ch/chh, both represented by /ch/.
  - |
    Double consonants: Double consonants represented by the tashdid (shaddah) are
    shown in most cases (e.g., Hassan, Muhammad). Exceptions: consonants
    represented by digraphs are not doubled (e.g., Mubashir [not Mubashshir]).
  - |
    Hamzah (glottal stop) and ayn: Unlike in the Arabic IC Standard, these are not
    represented in the IC standard.
  - |
    Digraphs: No distinction is made between digraphs such as /sh/ and single
    contiguous letters such as /s/ followed by /h/.
  - |
    Arabic definite article “al” (‘the’): Shows sun letter assimilation in the
    Romanized form (e.g., Abdur Rahman rather than Abdal Rahman, rather than
    Arabic IC standard 'Abd al-Rahman).
  - |
    Special Rules
    - |
      Hyphens: Hyphens (-) are NOT used to connect name elements within a name:
      Abdur Rahman. The single exception to this is the izafat (i.e., linking vowel in
      noun-link-modifier construction of Persian origin), which does show a hyphen
      before the /e/ and a following space: Koh-e Nur (‘mountain of light’), “Jaish-e
      xx” (‘Army of xx’ construction).
    - |
      Names incorporating “din” are written as one unit: Azermuddin, Badruddin,
    Faizuddin, Salahuddin.
    - |
      Names that incorporate Allah as part of the name show the Arabic grammatical
      marker /u/ rather than the /a/ of Allah: Abdullah (not Abdallah).
    - |
      Inherent short vowel /a/ in Devanagari is represented with an /a/ in Roman. Final
      consonants are assumed not to have a short /a/ (e.g., masc. name Ram Lal, not
      Rama Lala).
    - |
      As a general rule, Devanagari va is transcribed as a /v/: Vijay, Vishal, etc.
      Exception: /sw/ combination: Saraswati, Krishnaswami. Urdu wau, however, is
      transcribed as /w/: Wasim, Walid.
