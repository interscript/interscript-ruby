notes:
  - Segmentation needs to be done before using this map
  - Note 5 in the specification states that when identical repeating vowels
    belong to different kanji characters, they shall be romanized
    individually and an apostrophe (’) shall be placed between the vowels.
    However since this is a map from Kana to Hepburn, there is no way to
    implement this feature.
  - The documentation did not specify how the hyphen should be used.
