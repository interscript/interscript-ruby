  This romanization system agreed by BGN and PCGN in November 2007,
  accommodates the linguistic complexity of Afghanistan as manifest in
  its geographical names.

  The following tabulation shows the original Perso-Arabic script with
  accompanying Unicode value (columns 1a and b), the Yaghoubi
  romanization (column 2), the BGN/PCGN romanization with accompanying
  Unicode value (columns 3a and b), an English phonetic example (column
  4), and an example toponym (columns 5b and c).

  [The Yaghoubi romanization system was developed in 1959 by
  Muzaffarud Din Yaqubi (commonly seen as Yaghoubi). It is a native
  official system designed to reflect Afghan names, both Dari and Pashto,
  and both pronunciation and genuine linguistic truth.]

  The tables function as both a romanization system for Afghanistan (i.e.
  with access to the original script, these tables can be applied to get
  a standardized Roman result - moving from columns 1 to 3) and as a
  means of converting the available Yaghoubi Roman-script spellings, as
  appear on the Fairchild Aerial Surveys map series, to standard BGN/PCGN
  spellings (moving from columns 2 to 3).

  The points used in Arabic to mark short vowels and certain other
  diacritical marks are infrequently written in Afghanistan.
  Consequently, a reference source may sometimes be required to aid
  correct identification of the standard spellings and proper vowels and
  elimination of dialectal and idiosyncratic variations. In the interests
  of clarity, the example columns show script with vowel pointing from
  Arabic to indicate the short vowels that are included alongside the
  unpointed form that will usually be encountered. However it should be
  noted that the pronunciation of short vowels will vary.

  Note: it is recommended that a font such as Scheherazade, available
  from www.sil.org, which includes the Unicode extended Arabic sub-range,
  be used to view this system. [Please note that the identification of a
  particular font does not represent an endorsement of any specific
  product or manufacturer.]

notes:

    Alif (ا) should be romanized as follows:

    a. Initially, it indicates that the word begins with a vowel or
      diphthong; the alif itself is not romanized, but rather the short vowel
      it “carries” is romanized; e.g., ميړ أَسَلم ژرَندَه → Mī Aslam Zhrandah
    b. When it carries a maddah (آ) (see vowel table, row 6), it represents ā; e.g., آب بَند → Āb Band.
    c. Medially and finally it represents ā (see vowel table, row 5); e.g., ماڼۍ → Māṉêy
    d. Medially and finally in words of Arabic origin, alif may serve as the bearer of hamzah, e.g. رأس → ra’s.

  - Occasionally the letter sequences سه ,زه ,که, and گه occur without
    intervening vowels. They may be romanized k·h, z·h, s·h, and g·h in
    order to differentiate these romanizations from the digraphs kh, zh,
    sh, and gh, which are used to represent the letters ش ,ژ ,خ, and غ.
    Additionally, the Pashto letters څ and ځ, routinely romanized ts and
    dz, may be alternatively romanized s and z تس when for special reasons
    it is desired that confusion be avoided with the character sequences
    (ts) and دز (dz), respectively.

  - "The vagaries of written Afghan languages, as pertains to spacing
    and word division, are addressed as follows:
    Spaces may be added to or subtracted from Afghan words written in
    Arabic script, for the purposes of standardization. This is
    particularly relevant when the words are hand-written, are rendered
    “art st cally”, or express other s ch non-standard flourishes, as long
    as the sense of the toponym, word, or phrase is not compromised.
    Romanized toponyms are typically divided into constituent words
    (spaces and other grammatical rules applied) when those words can stand
    independently, for purposes of standardization and minimization of
    confusion, particularly in situations where Afghan writers are
    inconsistent in their application of spacing and word breaks. When the
    Afghan word or suffix is only used in combination with other nouns or
    adjectives, then it should be appended to the preceding word in its
    romanization. This includes (but is not limited to) - ābā , -zaī, -zā
    ah, - ū, -wand, -gaī, -kaī, -pūr, - ēsh, -lar, -lī, -lū and ullāh, as,
    for example, seen in Raḩmatābād (رحمت آباد) and Raḩmatullāh (رحمت االله),
    but Raḩmat Khēl (رحمتخيل) and Raḩmat Shahr (رحمتشهر)."

  - The one-letter words د (Pashto) and و (Dari) are romanized dê and
    wa, respectively.

  - The word الله, meaning God, should always be romanized Allāh,
    except as specified in note 3. Note that the Unicode value FDF2 spells
    Allāh, but omits the alif in some common fonts, including Times New
    Roman. If in doubt, try in Arial Unicode MS to verify. Also note that
    the “dagger al f” ( ) above the second ل (lām) n the ord الله, is not
    written but should be romanized ā, like a full-size alif.

  - In names of Arabic origin, the l of the definite article al s ass m
    lated before the ‘s n letters’ , , , , r, z, s, sh, ş, ẕ, , z, l and n.
    In its romanization, the article should be separated from the name it
    precedes and should not be capitalized except at the beginning of a
    name, e.g. جبل السراج→ Jabal
    as Sarāj

  - In Arabic names, a shaddah, ّ is used to denote the doubling of a
    particular consonant character, e.g. ُم َح َمد → Muḩammad. Ho ever, n
    Pashto th s ‘do bl ng’ s freq ently om tted n both Perso- Arabic script
    and the resulting romanization. Guidance on doubling may be taken from
    an authoritative names source, such as an Afghan government source or
    Pashto dictionary; for example, it is usual to see Ḩājī without and
    ‘Abbās with the doubled consonant. The doubled y consonant is almost
    always retained, as in Sayyid or Qayyūm.

  - In Afghan names which contain an iẕāfah, it should be romanized as
    -e or –ye according to
    common pronunciation, but generally, -e is used if the preceding word
    ends with a consonant other
    than silent heh, and -ye if the preceding word ends with a vowel
    sound e.g. غر ِحصار → Ghar-e ِ
    Ḩ şār; َقل َع ٔه َنو → Qal‘ah-ye Now. Scholarly sources indicate that
    heh is silent in darah and qal‘ah (thus darah-ye, qal‘ah-ye), but
    lightly spoken in kōh and chāh (thus kōh-e, chāh-e).

  - The character sequence خو, where followed by ا or ی should be
    romanized khwā or khwī, although the w is either not pronounced, or
    only weakly so, as in خواجه → khwājah.

  - Plural nouns ending in -hā or -ān should always be romanized as a
    single word, regardless of whether a space appears in a Perso-Arabic
    script source.

  - Unicode values listed in the tables above are required to ensure
    standardization and to minimize confusion from competing
    representations of a given character. It should be noted that the
    Persian Unicode value 0643 or FEDA( ك Unicode value 06A9) is
    recommended rather than the Arabic( ک or FED9), the Persian گ (Unicode
    value 06AF) is recommended rather than ګ (Unicode value 06AB) or ڰ
    (Unicode value 06B0) or ك (Unicode value 0643 or FEDA or FED9), and the
    Pashto character ځ (Unicode value 0681) is recommended rather than the
    heh with a dot above and a dot below (no Unicode value). For the letter ی
    in its many variations, care must be exercised to follow this romanization
    guide's recommendations to eliminate confusion for search engines
    and software. BGN/PCGN does not use the Unicode encoding FEEF for the
    character ی in any Afghan word.
