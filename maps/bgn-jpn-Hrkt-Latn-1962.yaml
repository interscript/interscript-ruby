description: |
  The BGN (Modified Hepburn) System for the transliteration of Japanese
  has been in use by the Board on Geographic Names since about 1930 and
  has been extensively employed in the systematic standardsization of
  thousands of geographic names of Japan in romanized form.

notes: |

  1. The "tsu" forms (ツ/つ) are also used to indicate a double consonant and
  are generally (but not alwyas) written in smaller script or type
  slightly to the right of or below the regular line. These characters
  are trasnliterated as k before k; s before s or sh; t before t, ts, or
  ch; and p before p. Occasionally, when a "ku" (ク/く) or "ki" (キ/き) form
  precedes k, the u in ku or the i in ki is dropped. 

  2. The transliterations in parentheses are used in specific cases when
  the kana symbol is known to be so pronounced. 

  3. The transliteration m is used before b, p, and m. 

  4. This letter has been added for the use in transliterating foreign
  words. 

  5. The asterisk (*) indicates standard combined forms. Those combined
  forms not so marked are rarely used.

  Additional Notes: 

  a. Despite the mentioning of the term "Modified Hepburn in the
  specification, the handling of ん/ン in this standard is different from
  Modified Hepburn. It follows the Traditional Hepburn in that the
  letter m is used before b, m, p. 

  b. This document includes obsolete (pre-reform) combinations.

  c. There is no discussion on how cross-morpheme vowel sounds should be
  handled.
