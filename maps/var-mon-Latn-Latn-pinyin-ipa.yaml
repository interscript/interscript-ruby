  The romanization of Chinese geographical names is closely related with the progress of the
  standardization of geographical names in the country. In 1977, the China Geographical Names
  Committee was set up. Composed of the representatives of related ministries, commissions and
  scientific institutes, it takes charge of drawing up the principles of standardized geographical
  names at home and abroad, organizes the departments concerned to gather, edit and check place
  names materials, and to compile reference books on geographical names and gives guidance to the
  standardization of geographical names throughout the country.

  Transcription of Mongolian place names is made from their proper pronunciation based on the written
  from of the Mongolian language and Qahar vernacular the Zhenglan as its representative pronunciation.
  The long and short vowels in the Mongolian language are not distinguished in the transcription.

notes:
  - The long and short Mongolian vowels are not distinguished in the spellings for general use,
    but in the recording the pronunciation of place names, the long vowel is represented by duplication.
  - Where two forms of the same letter, with and without a diacritical mark, are listed together for
    transcribing with Pinyin, the form with the diacritical mark is used for recording the pronunciation
    of place names, while the form without the diacritical mark is for general use.
