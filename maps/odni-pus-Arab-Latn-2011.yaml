  Pashto is a language characterized by its variability. The
  challenges of reaching a universally acceptable
  transliteration standard for personal names are posed both
  by the dialect spread trending roughly from the southwest
  to the northeast parts of its geographic area, and also by
  the competing influences of Dari and Urdu. Given the lack
  of any dominant standard on some points, it has been
  considered necessary to define a certain degree of
  flexibility within this standardization system in order to
  enable it to capture the variability of the language it
  seeks to reflect. A great effort has also been made to
  research and reflect common usage in the Pashto- speaking
  areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan, and to define rules
  which capture these trends to the best extent possible.
  However, a respect for the norms of usage has also been
  balanced with the need for consistency and intelligibility.
  Therefore, there are cases where a less common spelling
  will be the preferred usage under the guidance of this
  system. Lastly, specific names that cannot be incorporated
  gracefully into the rules described below are included with
  case-by-case preferred spellings in a list near the end of
  this document.

notes:
  # Special rules: Consonants
  - Pashto letter ge (‫ږ‬) The two common renderings for this
    letter are 'zh' and 'g.' 1 The preferred option will be
    'zh' (consistent with the choice of southern 'sh' for ‫)ښ‬.
    However, when referring to communities that consistently
    render the name with a 'g' as opposed to a 'zh,' then 'g'
    will be the preferred option. In these cases, the inclusion
    of a variant spelling with 'zh' is strongly encouraged.

  - Double consonants Double consonants represented by the
    tashdid (shaddah) are shown in most cases regardless of
    whether they are clearly enunciated in speech. Examples
    Muhammad Hassan, Izzatullah. However, consonants
    represented by digraphs are not doubled. Example Mubashir (
    not Mubashshir). Special care should be taken when
    possible to discriminate between doubled and
    non-doubled letters in names that are otherwise
    indistinguishable in their transliterated forms
    Hasan (حسن (vs. Hassan (حسان(

  - Digraphs No distinction is made between digraphs such as 'sh'
    and single contiguous letters such as 's' followed by 'h.'

  # Special rules: Vowels
  - Short vowels zair and pesh The preferred options for the
    short vowels represented by the zair and pesh will be 'i'
    and 'u.' However, in cases where there is a mixed Dari and
    Pashto environment, then the use of 'e' and 'o' is accepted
    in consideration of Dari norms.

  - Long/short vowels Long and short vowels are not
    distinguished in the system (with the exception of
    certain spellings driven by Dari influence as discussed
    above). In this and other systems, the borrowed
    Arabic name Salim could represent two distinct names, one
    with a long /a/ (Saalim - ‫)سالم and one with a
    long /i/ (Saliim - ‫)سلیم‬. This is known as a collision.
    This and many other prevailing standardization
    systems do not distinguish between these types of
    collisions. However, in cases like these, it is
    recommended that a vigorous effort be made to include
    variant spellings in order to eliminate ambiguity
    as to which name is intended, as in the following examples
    Hamid (var. Hameed) – ‫حمید‬
    Hamid (var. Hamed) – ‫حامد‬

  - Izafat The linking vowel of Persian origin known as the
    izafat will be written with a hyphen and then 'e'
    and then a following space. Example Koh-e Nur ("mountain
    of light"). There will be no special
    accommodation for when the initial word ends in a vowel.

  # Special rules: Arabic
  - The Arabic article al ( ‫ال‬ ) The Arabic article will be
    written with a lowercase 'a' and followed by a hyphen, with
    the obvious exception that an uppercase 'a' should be used
    where required by English orthographic conventions, e.g.,
    at the beginning of a sentence. Example Karim al-Afghani

  - Genitive constructions Multi-part Arabic names that follow
    the Arabic genitive construction will be written with a
    lowercase ul joined to the last part of the name by a
    hyphen. Arabic sun letter assimilation generally will not
    be shown.
  # Genitive construction exceptions
  - In deference to widespread usage, the name Abd will be
    combined with the genitive article ul,
    and the rest of the name will be written separately (
    specifically, one of the ninety-nine
    "names of God"). Examples Abdul Haq, Abdul Rahman
  - Names incorporating "--ullah" will be written as a single
    unit. Examples Abdullah, Rahmatullah
  - Names incorporating "--din" will be written as a single
    unit with sun letter assimilation
    shown, causing ul to change to ud. This type of name is the
    only case in which sun letter assimilation will be shown.
    Examples Jamaluddin, Shamsuddin
  - Note, no effort will be made to force names into the
    genitive construction if they are not
    linked by the article. For example, both names Fazl ul-
    Rahman and Fazl Rahman would be
    acceptable, depending on whether the article was included
    in the individual's name.

  - Consonant clusters Traditional Arabic names ending in a
    final consonant cluster will be spelled with the
    consonant cluster intact. Although most native Pashto
    speakers will break up the cluster in conversational
    speech, general usage in the written transliteration of
    names still favors the preservation of the consonant
    cluster in print.
    This type of name should not be confused with Arabic names whose orthography includes a zabar (short
    'a' vowel) prior to the final consonant. -- NOT DONE

  # Special rules: Multiple-part Pashto names
  - TODO

  # Special rules: Glides versus consonants
  - The unwritten phonetic "glides," also known as semi-
    consonants (sounding similar to /y/ and /w/), will
    generally not be shown between two vowels.
    Examples Rauf, Said (سعيد)

  - Care should be taken to distinguish the above rule from
    cases in which wao or ya are a written part of the name and
    function as true consonants, including cases where they are
    doubled. Examples Fayiz ( ‫فایز‬ ), Fayyaz ( ‫فیّاض‬ )

  - A common form where ya will be shown in its role as a
    consonant is with the Arabic nisba (suffix showing origin,
    relation, etc.) appended to names that end in a vowel.
    Examples Ziayi, Shafiyi, Mirzayi, Paktiayi

  # Specific rules: Exceptions
  - TODO
    In spite of best intentions, the unbending application of
    rules in any transliteration system is likely to produce
    some forms that fly in the face of accepted use. Therefore,
    the following names will be spelled as follows, in spite of
    minor variance with the rules described above.
    Aurangzeb (not Awrangzeb)
    Eid (not Id)
    Faizad (not Faizzad)
    Javed (not Jawed) 2
    Parvez (not Parwez)
    Qureshi (not Quraishi)
    Saad (not Sad)
    Sherpao (not Sherpaw)

  - The following names do not constitute exceptions to the
    rules of this standard, but they are names that pose
    significant challenges to standardization and are therefore
    listed here to ensure consensus
    Bahadur (not Bahadar, Bahader)
    Feroz (not Firoz, Fairuz, etc.)
    Firdaws (not Firdos)
    Husain (not Hussain)
    Isfandyar (not Asfandyar)
    Ismail (not Ismael)
    Khushhal (not Khushal)
    Niamat (not Nimat)
    Numan (not Nauman)
    Raza (not Reza)
    Sherzad (not Shirzad)
    Tor Jan (not Tur Jan)
    Uwais (not Awais)

  # Special rules: Titles
  - We treat the spelling of commonly used titles differently
    from the handling of names, given that titles are subject
    to norms of English as they are accepted into the English
    language. Though not specifically covered by the scope of
    this transliteration standard, the following spellings are
    recommended for the sake of consistency
    Akhund
    Amir
    Commander (not Commandan)
    Hafiz
    Haji
    Mawlana
    Mawlawi
    Mullah
    Qari
    Qazi
    Sahib
    Sheikh
    Syed ( ‫سیّد‬ )
    Ustad
