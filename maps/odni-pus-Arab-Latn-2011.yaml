  Pashto is a language characterized by its variability. The
  challenges of reaching a universally acceptable
  transliteration standard for personal names are posed both
  by the dialect spread trending roughly from the southwest
  to the northeast parts of its geographic area, and also by
  the competing influences of Dari and Urdu. Given the lack
  of any dominant standard on some points, it has been
  considered necessary to define a certain degree of
  flexibility within this standardization system in order to
  enable it to capture the variability of the language it
  seeks to reflect. A great effort has also been made to
  research and reflect common usage in the Pashto- speaking
  areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan, and to define rules
  which capture these trends to the best extent possible.
  However, a respect for the norms of usage has also been
  balanced with the need for consistency and intelligibility.
  Therefore, there are cases where a less common spelling
  will be the preferred usage under the guidance of this
  system. Lastly, specific names that cannot be incorporated
  gracefully into the rules described below are included with
  case-by-case preferred spellings in a list near the end of
  this document.

notes:
  - 1. Alif ( ‫ا‬ ) should be romanized as follows
    a. Initially,it indicates that the word begins with a vowel or
    diphthong; the alif itself is not romanized, but rather the
    short vowel it “carries” is romanized; e.g., Aslam Zhrandah
    ‫ه‬ َ‫د‬ ‫ن‬ ‫ژر‬ ‫سلَم‬ َ‫أ‬ ‫ميړ‬ → b. When it carries a
    maddah (‫)آ‬ (see vowel table, row 3), it represents ā;
    e.g., Band. Mīṟ ‫د‬ ‫ن‬ ‫ب‬ َ ‫آب‬ → Āb c. Medially and
    finally it represents ā (see table 2, row 2); e.g., ‫ۍ‬
    ‫ماڼ‬ → Māṉêy d. Medially and finally in words of Arabic
    origin, alif may serve as the bearer of hamzah, e.g.
    ‫رأس‬ → ra’s. See also note 4.

  - 2. The characters tsē ( ‫څ‬ ) and dzē ( ‫ځ‬ ) may be
    romanized t͡ s and d͡ z (the combining double breve (
    Unicode 0361) appearing over the digraph) when for special
    reasons it is desired that confusion be avoided between
    ‫ت‬ (t) plus ‫س‬ (s) and between ‫د‬ (d) plus ‫ز‬ (z),
    respectively.

  - 3. Occasionally the character sequences ‫ه‬ ‫ك‬ , ‫ه‬ ‫ز‬ ,
    ‫ه‬ ‫س‬ , and ‫ه‬ ‫گ‬ occur . They may be romanized k·h, z·
    h, s·h, and g·h in order to differentiate these
    romanizations from the digraphs kh, zh, sh, and gh, which
    are used to represent the characters ‫خ‬ , ‫ژ‬, ‫ش‬ , and
    ‫غ‬ respectively .

  - 4. Hamzah ( ‫ء‬ ) should be romanized as follows a. In
    word-initial position, where it will appear either above or
    below alif ( indicates a short vowel and should not itself
    be romanized. romanized by an apostrophe, e.g. ‫أ‬ or
    ‫إ‬ ), it In other positions it should be ‫جُزء‬ → juz’. b.
    Yeh with hamzah ( ‫ئ‬ ) should be romanized êy, unless it
    represents the compound (iẕāfah) morpheme, in which case it
    is romanized according to note 9 below.

  - 5. The division of words utilized in Pashto writing is
    followed in romanization, except that the elements –ābād, -
    khwā, -shahr, -zādah, -zay and -ullāh are always romanized
    as part of the preceding word, e.g. ‫آباد‬ ‫ت‬ ‫م‬ َ ْ‫ح‬
    ‫ر‬ َ → Raḩmatābād and ‫الله‬ ‫ت‬ ‫م‬ َ ْ‫ح‬ ‫ر‬ َ →
    Raḩmatullāh. However, when the word for God ( ‫الله‬ )
    appears as a standalone word it should be written Allāh.
    Note also the “dagger alif” ( ٙ) above the second ‫ل‬ (lām)
    in the word ‫الله‬ ; this, like the short vowels, is not
    written in Pashto but should be romanized ā, like a full-
    size alif. Persian derivational endings such as –vand and
    endings of Turkish origin such as –lar, -lī, -lū, -i, -u, -
    si, and –su, should be written together with the preceding
    word.

  - 6. The Pashto preposition ‫د‬ should be romanized dê in
    agreement with its pronunciation, despite the fact that
    it is sometimes pointed with kasrah ( ٙ ).

  - 7. In names of Arabic origin, the l of the definite article
    al/ul is assimilated before the ‘sun letters’ t, s̄ , d,
    z̄ , r, z, s, sh, ş, ẕ, ţ, z̧ , l and n. In romanization,
    the article will be written al or its assimilated
    equivalent in name-initial position but ul or its
    assimilated equivalent elsewhere; the article should be
    separated from the name it precedes and should not be
    capitalized, except at the beginning of a name, e.g. جَبَل
    السَرَاج → Jabal us Sarāj

  - 8. In Arabic names, a shaddah, ٙ is used to denote the
    doubling of a particular consonant character, e.g. ‫مَّد‬
    َ‫ح‬ ‫م‬ ُ → Muḩammad. However, in Pashto this ‘doubling’
    is frequently omitted in both Perso-Arabic script and the
    resulting romanization. Guidance on doubling may be taken
    from an authoritative names source, such as an Afghan
    government source or Pashto dictionary; for example, it is
    usual to see Ḩājī without and ‘Abbās with the doubled
    consonant. The doubled y consonant is almost always
    retained, as in Sayyid or Qayyūm

  - 9. The iẕāfah morpheme is not a grammatical feature of
    Pashto and, if encountered in a linguistically hybrid
    geographical name (i.e. combining features of both Pashto
    and Dari), it should be treated according to the BGN/PCGN
    national system of romanization for Afghanistan, 2007, as –
    e, unless the preceding word ends with a silent heh (‫)ه‬
    or a vowel when it should be shown – ye, e.g. 10. The
    character sequence ‫خو‬ , ‫صار‬ ‫ح‬ ِ ‫غر‬ → Ghar-e Ḩişār;
    ‫و‬ ‫ن‬ َ ‫ه‬ ٔ ‫لع‬ َ ‫ق‬ َ → when followed by ‫ا‬ or
    ‫ی‬ , Qal‘ah-ye Now.


  - 10. The character sequence خو when followed by ‫ا‬ or
    ‫ی‬ ,should be romanized khw, although the w is either not
    pronounced, or only weakly pronounced; e.g. ‫خواجه‬ →
    khwājah.

    basic Roman script is
