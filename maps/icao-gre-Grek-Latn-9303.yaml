description: |
  Part 3 defines specifications that are common to TD1, TD2 and TD3
  size machine readable travel documents (MRTDs) including those
  necessary for global interoperability using visual inspection and
  machine readable (optical character recognition) means.

  Since only Latin-alphabet characters are allowed in the VIZ, if
  mandatory data elements are in a national language that does not use
  the Latin alphabet, a transcription or transliteration shall also be
  provided.

  This document defines the transliteration mappings used to produce
  this transcription or transliteration.
