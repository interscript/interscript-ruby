  The United Nations recommended romanization
  system was approved in 1972 (resolution II/8),
  based on the system adopted by Arabic experts at
  the conference held at Beirut in 1971 with the
  practical amendments carried out and agreed upon
  by the representatives of the Arabic-speaking
  countries at their conference. The table was
  published in volume II of the conference report1
  . In the UN resolution it was specifically
  pointed out that the system was recommended "for
  the romanization of the geographical names within
  those Arabic-speaking countries where this system
  is officially acknowledged". It cannot be
  definitely ascertained which of the
  Arabicspeaking countries have adopted this system
  officially, especially since 2007 when there are
  efforts by the Arabic Division to promote a
  modification of the UN system (ADEGN
  romanization, see the section on other
  romanization systems below), with varying
  success2 . Judging by the use of names in
  international cartographic products which rely
  mostly on national sources it appears that the UN
  system or its modification is more or less
  current in Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Saudi Arabia3 ,
  United Arab Emirates and Yemen, there and in some
  other countries the system is often used without
  diacritical marks. For the geographical names of
  the Syrian Arab Republic international maps
  favour the UN system while the local usage seems
  to prefer a French-oriented romanization. Also in
  Egypt and Sudan there exist local romanization
  schemes or practices side by side with the UN
  system. The geographical names of Algeria,
  Djibouti, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia are
  generally rendered in the traditional manner
  which conforms to the principles of the French
  orthography. Resolution 7 of the Seventh UN
  Conference on the Standardization of Geographical
  Names (1998) recommended that "the League of Arab
  States should, through its specialized
  structures, continue its efforts to organize a
  conference with a view to considering the
  difficulties encountered in applying the amended
  Beirut system of 1972 for the romanization of
  Arabic script, and submit, as soon as possible, a
  solution to the United Nations Group of Experts
  on Geographical Names". At the Eighth UN
  Conference on the Standardization of Geographical
  Names (2002), the Arabic Division of the UN Group
  of Experts announced that it had finalised
  proposed modifications to the UN recommended
  romanization system. These proposals would be
  submitted to the League of Arab States for
  approval. Arabic is written from right to left.
  The Arabic script usually omits vowel points and
  diacritical marks from writing which makes it
  difficult to obtain uniform results in the
  romanization of Arabic. It is essential to
  identify correctly the words which appear in any
  particular name and to know the standard Arabic-
  script spelling including proper pointing. One
  must also take into account dialectal and
  idiosyncratic deviations. The romanization is
  generally reversible though there are some
  ambiguous letter sequences (dh, kh, sh, th) which
  may also point to combinations of Arabic
  characters in addition to the respective single
  characters.
notes:
  - |
    The previous UN 1972 System had the following differences:
    the character (ظ) was romanized as z̧ instead of d͟h;
    ح, ص, ض the cedilla (¸) was used instead of sub-macron (_) in all characters with sub-macrons.  - |
    When the definite article al precedes a word beginning with one of the "sun letters" (t,
    th, d, dh, r, z, s, sh, ş, ḑ, ţ, z, l, n ̧ ) the l of the definite article is assimilated with the first
    consonant of the word: ash-Sh الشارقة āriqah.
