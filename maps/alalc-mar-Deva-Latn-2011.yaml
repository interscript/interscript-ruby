notes:

  - Only the vowel forms that appear at the beginning of a syllable are listed; the forms used for
    vowels following a consonant can be found in grammars; no distinction between the two is
    made in transliteration.

  - |
    The vowel a is implicit after all consonants and consonant clusters and is supplied in
    transliteration, with the following exceptions:

    a) when another vowel is indicated by its appropriate sign; and
    b) when the absence of any vowel is indicated by the subscript sign ( ् ) called halanta or
       virāma.

  - |
    Exception: Anusvāra is transliterated by:

    a) ṅ before gutturals,
    b) ñ before palatals,
    c) ṇ before cerebrals,
    d) n before dentals, and
    e) m before labials.
    In other circumstances it is transliterated by a tilde (~) over the vowel.

  - When doubled, avagraha is transliterated by two apostrophes ( ’’ ).
