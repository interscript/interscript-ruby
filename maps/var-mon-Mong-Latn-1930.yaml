description: |
  Latin alphabet was using "y" as feminine "u", with additional
  feminine "o" ("ө") and with additional consonants "ç" for "ch", "ş"
  for "sh" and "ƶ" for "j", it successfully served in printing books
  and newspapers. A few of the letters (f, k, p, v) were rarely used,
  being found only in borrowings, while q, w and x were excluded
  altogether. Since k transcribed [h] in loans, it is unclear how loans
  in [kʰ] were written. "j" is used for vowel combinations of the [ja]
  type. Letter "c" is used for the sound [ts] and "k" is used for the 
  ound [h]. The first version was inspired by the Yanalif script used
  for the Soviet Union's Turkic languages.

  The orthography of the Mongolian Latin is based on the orthography of
  the Classical Mongolian script. It preserves short final vowels. It
  does not drop unstressed vowels in the closing syllables when the word
  is conjugated. The suffixes and inflections without long or i-coupled
  vowels are made open syllables ending with a vowel, which is harmonized
  with the stressed vowel. The rule for the vowel harmony for unstressed
  vowels is similar to that of the Mongolian Cyrillic. It does not use
  consonant combinations to denote new consonant sounds. For both of the
  version, letter "b" is used both in the beginning and in the middle of
  the word. Because it phonetically assimilates into sound [w], no
  ambiguity is caused.

notes:
  - A separated final form of vowels a or e is common, and can appear at the end
    of a word, word stem, or suffix. This form requires a final-shaped preceding
    consonant and an inter-word gap in between. The vowels themselves appear as ᠎ᠠ,
    and with consonants as ‍ᠬ᠎ᠠ q‑a, ‍ᠷ᠎ᠠ r‑a/r‑e, etc. This gap can be transliterated
    with a hyphen. In digital typesetting, these forms are triggered by inserting
    a U+180E ᠎ MONGOLIAN VOWEL SEPARATOR (HTML &#6158; · MVS) between the consonant
    and vowel.
  - All case suffixes, as well as any plural suffixes consisting of one or two
    syllables are likewise separated by a preceding and hyphen-transliterated gap.
    In digital typesetting, this gap is represented by a U+202F   NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE
    (HTML &#8239; · NNBSP). A maximum of two case suffixes can be added to a stem.
    Single-letter vowel suffixes appear with the final-shaped forms of a/e, i, or u/ü,
    as in ᠭᠠᠵᠠᠷ ᠠ γaǰar‑a 'to the country' and ᠡᠳᠦᠷ ᠡ edür‑e 'on the day', or ᠤᠯᠤᠰ ᠢ ulus‑i
    'the state' etc. Multi-letter suffixes most often start with an initial- (consonants),
    medial- (vowels), or variant-shaped form.


  # Note: Provedid sample of "Latin 1931-1939" in https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_Latin_alphabet is not actual transliteration.
  # It's kind of buggy transliteration that mixes Cyrillic and Traditional Mongolian script into Latin based on phonetic sound.
  # There is no expected transliteration sources found for the tests.
