name: REPORT ON THE CURRENT STATUS OF UNITED NATIONS ROMANIZATION SYSTEMS FOR GEOGRAPHICAL NAMES -- Russian Romanization system
url: http://www.eki.ee/wgrs/rom1_ru.htm
creation_date: 1987

description: |
  The United Nations recommended system was approved in 1987 (V/18),
  based on the official system of the Main Administration of Geodesy and
  Cartography of the former Soviet Union, also known as the GOST 1983
  system (GOST 16876-71). The table was published as an annex to the
  resolution.

  The system is used in the Russian Federation and increasingly in
  international cartographic products.

  Russian uses the Cyrillic script which is alphabetic. The
  romanization table is unambiguous and can be applied automatically. The
  system is reversible, although rarely there can be ambiguities.
