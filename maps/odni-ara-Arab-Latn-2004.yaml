notes:
  - Long/Short Vowels Long and short vowels are not
    distinguished in this system Samir (could be Saamir or
    Samiir in Arabic).

  - Double consonants Double consonants represented by the
    Arabic shaddah are shown in most cases (e.g., Hassan,
    Muhammad). Exceptions ’ayn and consonants represented by
    digraphs are not doubled (e.g., al-Qadhafi [not
    alQadhdhafi], Mubashir [not Mubashshir]).

  - Hamzah (glottal stop) The hamzah is represented by an
    apostrophe (’). Note that this is the same symbol used to
    represent another consonant, the ’ayn.

  - Ta’ marbutah (feminine ending marker) On the construct
    form or when pronounced “t”, it is represented with a roman
    t. In all other cases, it is represented with an h.

  - Digraphs No distinction is made between digraphs such as
    sh and single contiguous letters (e.g., s followed by h).

  - Definite article “al” (‘the’) Follows Arabic spelling
    rather than pronunciation. That is, sun letter assimilation
    is not shown in the Romanized form (e.g., ’Abd-alRahman,
    not ’Abd-ar-Rahman).

  - Diphthongs the second element of the diphthong is
    represented by a y or a w (rather than an i or a u)
    Haytham, Faysal, Tawfiq, Rawdah.

  - Hyphens Hyphens (-) are used to connect name elements
    within a name ’Abd- al Rahman, Abu-al-Bashar, Bin-Ladin.
    Exceptions Names that incorporate “Allah” as part of the
    name (e.g., ’Abdallah, Nasrallah), names marked by the
    lineage/family marker “Al” (e.g., Al Thani) are not
    hyphenated.

  - The definite article, “al”, within name phrases, is
    Romanized as al and not as ul Nur-al-Din (not Nur-ul-Din).
    It is not capitalized when name-initial.

  - Names that incorporate Allah as part of the name retain the
    a of Allah rather than a grammatical marker u ’Abdallah (
    not ’Abdullah).

  - Foreign names borrowed or appearing in Arabic are spelled
    according to the standard Western tradition Georges,
    Michel. However, names of non-Arabic origin no longer
    considered foreign by Arabic speakers follow the IC
    conventions Butrus (not Peter).

  - Prefix ‫بن‬ (bin ‘son of’) is Romanized Bin unless written
    with an alif, in which case it is Romanized as Ibn. The
    colloquial form Bu (‘father’) should not be standardized as
    Abu. These prefixes are capitalized.

  - In general, Romanization follows the Modern Standard
    Arabic (MSA) form rather than local pronunciation
    standards. For example, the letter ‫ج‬ (jim) is represented
    as a j even when pronounced as a “g” (e.g., Egyptian Gamal
    is Romanized as Jamal).
