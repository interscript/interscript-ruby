= Usage with Secryst

Secryst is a seq2seq transformer suited for transliteration. Written in Ruby.
It's installation is a bit tricky, you should consult its own installation guide
(https://github.com/secryst/secryst[at GitHub]). By default we don't use Secryst,
unless you have installed it.

== Using it standalone

It's enough to install it. Be sure to consult the guide above.

== Integration with Ruby Applications

In your Gemfile, add:

[source,ruby]
----
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "secryst"
----

Create a Secrystfile near your Gemfile with the following, for each model you
want to use in your application. Please consult our Secrystfile to get all the
maps needed to

[source,ruby]
----
model "model-name"
----

== Usage inside maps

[source,ruby]
----
stage {
  # ... sub "a", "b" ...
  secryst model: "model-name"
  # ... sub "c", "d" ...
}
----

As of now, Secryst is usable only by the Ruby implementation.
