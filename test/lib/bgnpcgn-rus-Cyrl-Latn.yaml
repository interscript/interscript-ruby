description: |
  The BGN/PCGN system for Russian was adopted by the BGN in 1944 and by the
  PCGN in 1947 for use in romanizing names written in the Russian Cyrillic
  alphabet.
  
notes:
  - The character e should be romanized ye initially, after the vowel 
    characters a, e, ё, и, о, у, ы, э, ю, and я, and after й, ъ, and ь. In 
    all other instances, it should be romanized e.
    
  - The character ё is not considered a separate character of the 
    Russian alphabet and the dieresis is generally not shown. When the 
    dieresis is shown, the character should be romanized yë initially, 
    after the vowel characters a, e, ё, и, о, у, ы, э, ю, and я, and after 
    й, ъ, and ь. In all other instances, it should be romanized ё. When the 
    dieresis is not shown, the character may still be romanized in the 
    preceding manner or, alternatively, in accordance with note 1.

    Unusual Russian character sequences occurring primarily in 
    non-Russian-language names may be romanized as shown below in order to 
    provide differentiation from regularly- occurring digraphs and 
    character sequences.
      й before а, у, ы, or э у·
      ы before а, у, ы, or э у·
      ы after any vowel character ·у
      э after any consonant character except й ·е
      TC t·s шч sh·ch
      
  - Unicode values are shown with the uppercase Cyrillic character first, 
    followed by the lowercase character.

    An inventory of letter-diacritic combinations, with their Unicode 
    encoding, in addition to the unmodified letters of the basic Roman 
    script is:
      All apostrophes appearing in romanization are U+2019 Ë (U+00CB)
      ë (U+00EB)
  - The Romanization column shows only lowercase forms but, when 
    romanizing, uppercase and lowercase Roman letters as appropriate should 
    be used.
